# CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation and layout of web pages. It works alongside HTML to control the appearance of elements on a page, making it a fundamental technology for web design.

## Key Features

- **Styling and Layout**: CSS allows developers to control the colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning of elements on a web page.
- **Separation of Content and Design**: CSS enables the separation of content (HTML) from design, making it easier to maintain and update the presentation layer without changing the structure of the HTML.
- **Cascading Rules**: CSS follows a cascading priority scheme where rules are applied based on specificity, inheritance, and importance, allowing developers to layer and override styles easily.
- **Selectors**: CSS uses a wide range of selectors (e.g., class, ID, element, attribute selectors) to target specific HTML elements or groups of elements for styling.
- **Responsive Design**: CSS supports responsive web design through features like media queries, flexbox, and grid, enabling websites to adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.
- **Animations and Transitions**: CSS provides powerful tools for creating animations and transitions, allowing smooth, interactive visual effects without needing JavaScript.

## Common Layout Techniques

- **Flexbox**: A layout module that makes it easy to align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their sizes are dynamic or unknown.
- **CSS Grid**: A two-dimensional layout system for complex web layouts, allowing developers to create grid-based designs with precise control over rows and columns.
- **Box Model**: CSS treats every element as a box, and the box model consists of margins, borders, padding, and the content itself, giving full control over spacing and element dimensions.
